## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **Why does `requireAuth()` connect `Community 1` to `Community 0`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.021) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `POST()` connect `Community 0` to `Community 1`, `Community 3`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.019) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Are the 2 inferred relationships involving `POST()` (e.g. with `requireAuth()` and `signToken()`) actually correct?**
  _`POST()` has 2 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Are the 3 inferred relationships involving `GET()` (e.g. with `middleware()` and `requireAuth()`) actually correct?**
